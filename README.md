Inspired by a video game <ins>[Elden Ring](https://www.google.com/search?q=elden+ring&oq=elden+ring&aqs=chrome..69i57j46i433i512j0i433i512l2j0i512l2j0i433i512l4.927j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)</ins> that sold key items called Bell Bearings that serve specific purposes, I expanded a course project that utlizes modern technologies using the Shopify + TailwindCSS + Next.js stack.

## Lessons Learned:

[Speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_Gonzales) is vastly important especially in E-commerce. This tech stack is all about speed. Faster load times means lower bounce rate also means higher conversion. Include the fast deployment with Vercel and now you got faster iterations which means lower development costs.
